# And 
# Or

num = 11

#if (num > 10) and (num > 100) :
	#print("Ur Number is Greater than 10 and Greater Than 100 !") # its mean when we use function and the condition both of that must be true
																 # example when we use variable its number 11, u know that when we craete condition 
																 # numb > 10 its mean yes thats true 11 more than 10 but not true 11 greater than 100
																 # so automatic print in the bash cant show anything or its false

# How about using function Or Like this below

if (num > 10 ) or (num > 100) :
	print("Ur Number Greater than 10 ")
# its mean which one of that is true and then the bash will show 11 more than 10
