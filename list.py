names = ["Abba", "Anita", "Bactiar"]

names[0] = "Ilham"

print(names) # in this case , first variable 3 list name and always remember always get it start 0 1 2 3 
			 # The second variable want to start 0 with data type is string "Ilham"
			 # result show 3 list name but Abba its not in the list 
# Now We call function append to add more list and show of all

#Second Variable its different like
