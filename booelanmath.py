#Lecture 1
#num = 10 # a Number 

#print(num) when we start with call variable in the case num, so absolutely the identification show a int is 10
# but when we put function float like below
#print(float(num)) 

#Lecture 2
# Now we can get it started move with another diffrent think.
# Combination with Math, Strings , integer and float

num = "5" # in this case 5 its not int but its a string and we can do math in this strings 

print(int(num) * 2) # so i use function int to made the result its 10 right ? cause that can be going to math lesson 
					# its can diffrent answer if we just call num
					# Please, u try print(num * 2) what u can see
					# sure, the answer in ur bash show 55 or when we changed variable with another string like "Sam"
					# absolutely the answer is samsam in ur bash
